<h2><strong>What is Elemental battlegrounds?</strong></h2>
<p>Elemental Battlegrounds is a game on  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox" target="_blank">Roblox</a> where players can use different elemental attacks to battle each other.
You earn shards and Diamonds from each player you kill which can be used to buy elements. Each element has a moveset with 5 unqiue attacks to be unlocked. 
If we get creative, we can combine certain attacks to create combos which are capable of <em>instant-killing</em> your opponent if done correctly.
Here is a list of 3 of the most <strong>overpowered</strong> combos the game has to offer.</p>

<br>
<h2><strong>PLAYING WITH FIRE</strong></h2>
<p><em>ELEMENTS REQUIRED</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Splitting Slime - Slime</li>
  <li>Great Fire Blast - Fire</li>
  <li>Scorching Basalt - Lava</li>
  <li>Temporal Trap - Time</li>
</ul>
<p>Fire and lava attacks are pretty cool, they can leave a burning AOE effect on the ground but
nothing's stopping the enemy from simply just walking out of the AOE. So, why don't we trap them
in place and force them to sit in the flames? This combo does exactly that, resulting in a slow, 
satisfying death while you just sit back and relax</p>
<P>COMBO STEPS</P>
<ol>
  <li>Stun Enemy with Spitting Slime</li>
  <li>Aim Great fire Blast at stunned enemy</li>
  <li>Aim scorching basalt at stunned enemy</li>
  <li>Trap enemy in Temporal trap</li>
  <li>Watch as enemy burns in the temporal Trap</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<h2><strong>RAINING CHAOS</strong></h2>
<p><em>ELEMENTS REQUIRED</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Bloodcurdling Blast - Nightmare</li>
  <li>Space-Time Rupture - Chaos</li>
  <li>Temporal Trap - Time</li>
</ul>
<p>This combo will leave your enemy in fear as they look up and see chaos raining from above.
Once your enemy gets stuck in your temporal trap, all they can do is helplessly watch as your
Space-Time Rupture slowly melts them away for an instant kill. This combo is satisfying to
pull off and is perfect if you're the type of player who likes to "savor" their kill.</p>
<p>COMBO STEPS</p>
<ol>
  <li>Stun Enemy with Bloodcurdling Blast</li>
  <li>Activate Space-Time Rupture</li>
  <li>Trap stunned enemy in Temporal Trap</li>
  <li>Aim Space-Time Rupture at Trapped Enemy</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>THE ATOMIC BOMB</strong></h2>
<p><em>ELEMENTS REQUIRED</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Comet Crash - Space</li>
  <li>Amaurotic Lambent - light</li>
  <li>Spiky Shield - Nature</li>
  <li>Shoot Great Fire Blast at stunned enemy/li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine casually walking around and you see a giant flaming ball crash and blind you. 
The next thing you know, you've been disintegrated. This combo is basically that, an atomic 
bomb. Once your enemy is blinded from your comet crash, they will wait for their vision to 
comeback and the next they see is their character, absolutly evaporated. This combo is very 
easy to use and doesn't require much aim, as all of your attacks are AOE.</p>
<P>COMBO STEPS</P>
<ol>
  <li>Blind enemy with Comet Crash</li>
  <li>stun enemy with Amaurotic Lambent</li>
  <li>Activate Spiky Shield</li>
  <li>Aim Great Fire Blast at stunned enemy</li>
</ol>
